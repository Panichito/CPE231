<h1>About us</h1>
<h6>We're a group of little students in the second year of the Department of Computer Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Mongkut%27s_University_of_Technology_Thonburi" target="_blank">KMUTT</a>. We're developing a project on the hotel database system to help with traveller's hotel reservations.<br><br>
This is the project that the authors are pleased with. We've completely abandoned our splendid Songkran lives to assist in the creation of the front-end and back-end stuffs. Please have mercy on us and lead us to the path of the eternal brightness.<br><br></h6>
